                  -----------------------------

StateMachine::Gestinanna is a fairly simple state machine 
implementation that is driven by the application.  It does not 
actually drive an application but provides hints as to what the 
application should do next.  It is designed to be especially 
helpful in an Model/View/Controller web-application environment 
to help the controller decide which view should be used.  However, 
it may also be used in other areas, such as traditional GUIs.

StateMachine::Gestinanna supports both ISA and HASA inheritance 
of state transition definitions and code triggered by those 
transitions.  This allows the development of classes of applications.

To install StateMachine::Gestinanna, download the distribution, 
untar, and cd into the resulting directory.  There, run the 
following:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

The author lurks on both the HTML::Mason list and the mod_perl list as 
well as various IRC channels.  Feel free to send questions there.
