                  -----------------------------

StateMachine::Gestinanna is a fairly simple state machine 
implementation that is driven by the application.  It does not 
actually drive an application but provides hints as to what the 
application should do next.  It is designed to be especially 
helpful in an Model/View/Controller web-application environment 
to help the controller decide which view should be used.  However, 
it may also be used in other areas, such as traditional GUIs.

StateMachine::Gestinanna supports both ISA and HASA inheritance 
of state transition definitions and code triggered by those 
transitions.  This allows the development of classes of applications.

To install StateMachine::Gestinanna, download the distribution, 
untar, and cd into the resulting directory.  There, run the 
following:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

The following modules are required:

  Class::Container 0.07
  Data::FormValidator 1.9
  Error 0.15
  Params::Validate 0.24
  YAML 0.35

The author lurks on the mod_perl list as well as various IRC channels.  
The list for the Gestinanna project is also appropriate.  Feel free to 
send questions there.  

If any tests fail, you may rerun `make test' with the DEBUG environment 
variable set to a true value.  This will output quite a few debug 
messages for any failed tests.

See StateMachine::Gestinanna::Examples::MailForm for an example state 
machine.  See the t/900mailform.t test script for an example of how to 
drive it.
